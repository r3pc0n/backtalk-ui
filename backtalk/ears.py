"""The ears — mic capture with VAD endpointing, transcribed by
faster-whisper (default: local, free, no server, no API key) or,
with stt_mode="cloud", sent to whichever engine stt_cloud_provider
names instead (today: Mistral's Voxtral, on YOUR key — see
_get_voxtral_key). Cloud mode falls back to
local whisper on any failure — network, bad key, rate limit — same
degrade-never-mute rule mouth.py follows for TTS, and it skips loading
the local model at startup entirely (see warm()), so a
resource-limited machine never pays for local weights it isn't using.
Mic capture and VAD endpointing are always local either way — only the
transcription step leaves the machine.

record_held() is the hold-to-talk capture (the button is the VAD).
Ears.listen_once() is the legacy open-mic mode: blocks until one
complete utterance is heard, then returns its transcript. Endpointing:
an utterance opens after ~120ms of sustained speech, closes after
`silence_ms` of trailing quiet. A `gate` callable can suppress
listening (so the open mic ignores the speakers unless barge-in is on).
